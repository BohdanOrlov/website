### Whooley

[Whooley](http://whooley.com/) is an app about **bringing friends together** where I delivered a unique look-and-feel and created a variety of **complex UI controls**. 

The app was heavily dependant on **location services** and responsive chat module. 

I had a chance to **mentor iOS developers** who joined the team as the product grew.
Additionally, I went on a business trip to Reston, VA to **coordinate Product and Tech teams** which were based in USA and Ukraine respectively.
