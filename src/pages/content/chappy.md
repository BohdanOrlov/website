### Chappy

I was thrilled to help [Chappy](https://chappyapp.com/) because it has a **noble mission** of making the **gay dating safer** and being a **single iOS engineer** was a real chalange, to compare, Grindr has 5+ and Tinder has 20+ iOS developers respectively.

In the first year, the startup reached **50k DAU** with **99.9% crash-free** users and **4.1 rating** in App Store reviews (Grindr has 2.0 rating).

The codebase features **service-based three-layer architecture**, reusable **UI components** and includes **snapshot testing** for visual regression.
