### Teachers Pay Teachers

My career was rocket-started by developing an e-commerce app for [TpT]((http://teacherspayteachers.com)) single-handedly and from scratch. The app achieved: 

- 100k users
- initial version crash rate of 5% per 1000 sessions
- 4.5/5 avg rating
- 50k downloads the first week

Besides that, I **mentored two iOS interns** and set up a CI via **Jenkins** along with **acceptance tests** using Jasmine and UI Automation (JavaScript).
