### Badoo

I moved to London to work for [Badoo](https://badoo.com/), the world's biggest dating company with **385+ million users** worldwide. 

It was the place where I improved my skills by implementing **video chat** and achieving Foursquare-like preciseness of **location services** used in the app. Adopted **TDD**, implemented dozens of features including **3D Touch** and was writing **client-server protocol** and documentation.

Additionally, I broadened my understanding of the **iOS community** by interviewing 100+ iOS candidates and **represented iOS engineering** on two hiring events.

During this time I realised the **importance of sharing knowledge** with the community.
