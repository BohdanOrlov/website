###Iâ€™m an iOS Engineer and Team Lead from Ukraine living in London


**Timely** delivered **quality** iOS apps are what I do the best, owing to the combination of inborn **perfectionism** and **laziness**. These partly contradicting traits are often very fruitful. In fact, many **pragmatic, beautiful and fitting solutions** appeared due to this **weird** tandem.

At the same time, I realise that **achieving** something **significant** takes the **coordinated** effort of many **people**, so this is where my interest in **leading people** comes from. 

Chasing a **better** place to improve my engineering **skills** and supporting our **community** eventually brought me to **London**. 

###iOS Engineer

I started as an **intern** working on a greenfield iOS app and very quickly proved that I could **deliver** the app.

I **dived** into iOS platform, and after a couple of years I ended up graduating from the company making **the biggest dating app** in the world with a lot of engineering experience and friends over my shoulders.

###iOS Team Lead

As I started to **grow and influence** less experienced developers I realised that I had to do this in a **structured** way, so I started to **write** articles about software design and eventually **talked** about it publicly.

My natural next step was to take formal **responsibility** **over the growth** of an iOS team. This role challenges me from a completely different side and keeps me **growing as a human**.

My beliefs consist of:

- **reason** over passion
- focus on the final **result**
- **improvement** of means of achieving
- **minimisation** of engineering **elitism**
- **sharing** **knowledge** by default
