[onefinestay](https://www.onefinestay.com/) **gives you an iPhone** while you are staying at someone's home. The iOS guest app gives access to the customer support, area guide, home instructions and designed to make your stay to feel like home very quickly. Also, I've worked on an enterprise app for people maintaining properties which required **background data upload** and complex **Core Data** persistence stack.

I setup development process for sharing and **reusing code** in-house with Cocoapods and created **Code Style and Architecture Guidelines** to increase code quality. 

Implemented AV Foundation-based Camera with **capture quality control** & custom UI.

Improved app stability with acceptance (KIF) and unit tests and setup CI process via Jenkins, Fabric, Git, Cocoapods and **fastlane**.
