### iOS Architecture Blog

I [write about software design in iOS](https://medium.com/@borlov). 

My article about [iOS architecture patterns](https://medium.com/ios-os-x-development/ios-architecture-patterns-ecba4c38de52) has more than 450000 views and referenced by expert iOS developers including [Uber engineers](https://eng.uber.com/new-rider-app/). 
An aspiring iOS engineer Igor Savynskyi commented on it: "Your top article about iOS architectures is a lighthouse for iOS developers." 

According to Google search, it has 370+ mentions in other articles and presentations. Also, I gave public speeches at "NSLondon" (17000 views on [slides](http://slides.com/borlov/arch#/)), "Swift Ninjas" and "Papers We Love"
